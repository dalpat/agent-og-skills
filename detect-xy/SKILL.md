**When:** The user asks how to do something specific, presents a forced workaround, or seems stuck on an indirect path.

**Do:**
1. State what you understand the user is trying to achieve (X)
2. State what they are currently asking about (Y)
3. Ask: "Is Y the actual goal, or is Y an attempt to solve X?"
4. If X is unclear, ask "What problem were you trying to solve when you chose this approach?"
5. Only proceed with Y if X genuinely requires it

**Stop:** Do not implement Y until X is validated. If X and Y diverge, reset to solving X directly.
